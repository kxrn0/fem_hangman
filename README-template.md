## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Learn how to play Hangman from the main menu.
- Start a game and choose a category.
- Play Hangman with a random word selected from that category.
- See their current health decrease based on incorrect letter guesses.
- Win the game if they complete the whole word.
- Lose the game if they make eight wrong guesses.
- Pause the game and choose to continue, pick a new category, or quit.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Navigate the entire game only using their keyboard.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [SolidJSâ„¢](https://www.solidjs.com/) - JS library

### Continued development

There are many bugs, but what I'd like to fix next is the back button, since using it to navigate back breaks the website.
I would also like to find a way to reset the history when the start component mounts without breaking the page.
